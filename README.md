# Hi there üëã
## About me üí¨
My name is <b>Raluca</b> and I am a <b>Senior Risk Analyst</b> with a strong background in data analytics and a passion for using data to drive business decisions. I have experience in the reinsurance industry, where I enhanced the internal model and improved the risk assessment process. I also have a PhD in political science from Trinity College Dublin, where I conducted a survey-experiment in Kenya and used advanced statistical models to assess the political impact of Chinese economic engagement in Africa.

## Skills üíª

- Data gathering (e.g. _Python_ - requests, bs4/BeautifulSoup, boto3, pyodbc; survey-experiment; _SQL_ - MySQL, Redshift, data lake such as Dremio; _Excel_ - power query)
- Data processing (EDA using _Python_ - matplotlib, pandas, numpy, seaborn; _Excel_ - formulas, pivot)
- Modelling (R - lme4, ordinal, panelAR, plm, Python - Scikit-learn, Tyche)
- Data visualization (PowerBI, Tableau, R and Python - matplotlib, seaborn)
- Orchestrating complex data pipelines (using Aiflow)
- Cloud infrastructure (AWS - S3, EC2, Redshift)

## Projects üöÄ

Here are some of the projects that I am currently working on:

- [TED talks NLP recommendation system](https://github.com/women-in-ai-ireland/September-2023-Group-001): A project part of WaiPRACTICE September cohort 2023 (WAI - Women in Ai Ireland) which involved building a content-based NLP recommendation system using sentiment analysis and similarities measures. I also built a web scraper using API requests ([soon-to-be python library](https://github.com/RalucaN/oratix)) and a [TED talks recommender Streamlit app](https://ted-recommender-app.streamlit.app/).
- [Steam reviews](https://github.com/RalucaN/Steam_reviews): A project that aims to analyze user reviews about the game Valheim on Steam to understand why a game with such low quality graphics has a great reception from players. This project involves data collection using public API, data processing using Python, data analysis using descriptive and inferential statistics, visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn, model building and evaluation using scikit-learn and TensorFlow, and results communication and presentation using Jupyter notebook


Here are some of the projects that I have worked on:
- [Women in Data Science Accelerator 2020](https://github.com/RalucaN/PRODCO-DS): A project that involved conducting root cause analysis to predict defects in production using decision tree model (R- RPART and Python - Boruta for feature selection, Python - Scikit-learn for modelling, Graphviz and dtreeviz for visualization).
- [Political Impact of Chinese Economic Engagement in Africa](https://github.com/RalucaN/Data-projects/tree/master/PhD_thesis(2015-2019)): PhD thesis - project that involved conducting a survey-experiment in Kenya and using advanced statistical models (e.g., multilevel, ordinal logistic, panel data model) to provide an in-depth assessment of the political impact of Chinese economic engagement in Africa.
- [Profiling electoral candidates](https://github.com/RalucaN/Data-projects/tree/master/Text%20analysis%20project%20using%20R%20(2016%20and%202020)): My first NLP project that involved using quanteda package and doing a content analysis of a 2016 presidential debate of US Democratic Party‚Äôs candidates.
