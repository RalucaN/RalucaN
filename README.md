# Hi there 👋
## About me 💬
My name is <b>Raluca</b> and I am a <b>Senior Risk Analyst</b> with a strong background in data analytics and a passion for using data to drive business decisions. I have experience in the reinsurance industry, where I enhanced the internal model and improved the risk assessment process. I also have a PhD in political science from Trinity College Dublin, where I conducted a survey-experiment in Kenya and used advanced statistical models to assess the political impact of Chinese economic engagement in Africa.

## Skills 💻

- Data gathering (e.g. survey, interviews, SQL DBs/Dremio or data lake)
- Data processing (EDA using Excel, R, or Python)
- Modelling (R - lme4, ordinal, panelAR, plm, Python - Scikit-learn, Tyche)
- Data visualization (PowerBI, Tableau, R and Python - matplotlib, seaborn)
- Orchestrating complex data pipelines (using Aiflow)
- Cloud infrastructure (AWS - S3, EC2, Redshift)
  
## Projects 🚀

Here are some of the projects that I have worked on:

- [Steam reviews]: A project that aims to analyze user reviews about the game Valheim on Steam to understand why a game with such low quality graphics has a great reception from players. This project involves data collection using public API, data processing using Python, data analysis using descriptive and inferential statistics, visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn, model building and evaluation using scikit-learn and TensorFlow, and results communication and presentation using Jupyter notebook
- [Women in Data Science Accelerator 2020]: A project that involved conducting root cause analysis to predict defects in production using decision tree model (R- RPART and Python - Boruta for feature selection, Python - Scikit-learn for modelling, Graphviz and dtreeviz for visualization).
- [Political Impact of Chinese Economic Engagement in Africa]: A project that involved conducting a survey-experiment in Kenya and using advanced statistical models (e.g., multilevel, ordinal logistic, panel data model) to provide an in-depth assessment of the political impact of Chinese economic engagement in Africa.
- [Profiling electoral candidates]: My first NLP project that involved using quanteda package and doing a content analysis of a 2016 presidential debate of US Democratic Party’s candidates.

## Achievements 🏆

Some of the achievements that I have accomplished are:

- Graduated with a PhD in Political Scienece from Trinity College Dublin.
- Completed Accenture’s “Women in Data Science Accelerator”.
- Won the Irish Research Council Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholarship, a highly competitive and prestigious research grant with an average success rate of 18% and a total amount of €48,000.
